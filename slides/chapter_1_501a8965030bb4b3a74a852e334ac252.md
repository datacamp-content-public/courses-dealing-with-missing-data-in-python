Hi 
In this lesson, you will learn about different types of missing data.

## Different types of Missing Data

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "cbb56a97f3"
```

`@part1`
- MCAR  (Missing completely at random) 

- MAR   (Missing at random) 

- MNAR  (Missing not at random)


`@script`
There are different types of missing data. The missing data can be MCAR (Missing completely at random), MAR (Missing at random) or MNAR (Missing not at random).


---
## What is MCAR ?

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "55e4dd2295"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
Missingness on a variable has no relationship with:
- the variable containing the missing values
- any other observed variable

**Income** {{0}}
- Low (<100) {{0}}
- High (>=100) {{0}}

## MCAR

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "fde66532b6"
```

`@part1`
- Impute {{0}}

- Delete observations containing missing data which will not bias.{{1}}


`@part2`

- Loss of data {{3}}

## What is MAR ?

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "27199fa90f"
```

`@part1`
Missingness on a variable is:
- not related to the variable containing missing values 
- is related to some other observed variable  


**How to deal ?** {{1}}
1. Impute {{2}}
1. Deleting observations may lead to bias. {{3}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4411/datasets/366de251cf9dc8c0349b4a63f69d64bcfd93cf21/MAR.png) {{0}}


`@script`
What is MAR ?

Missingness on a variable is:
- not related to the variable containing missing values 
- is related to some other observed variable  

The values in Income variables are missing for people of age 30 or younger. So, missingness depends on the values of age variable but not on the values of Income variable since both low and high income values are missing.


---
## What is MNAR ?

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "67bf629fae"
```

`@part1`
Missingness on a variable is related to the values of that variable itself. 

**How to deal ?** {{1}}

- Nonignorable {{2}}

- Deleting observations will definitely lead to bias. {{3}}

- Imputation does not neccessarily provide better outcome. {{4}}

- Sensitive analysis {{5}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4411/datasets/73bce43860bda6b2226225d80dc9c3e92d756530/MNAR.png)  {{0}}


`@script`
What is MNAR ? 
Missingness on a variable is related to the values of that variable itself. 
In this case, only low income values are missing. So, the missingness depends on the values of the income variable itself.

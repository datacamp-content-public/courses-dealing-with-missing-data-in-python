Hi 
In this lesson, you will learn about different types of missing data.


---


```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "3c67d1cdd1"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
In the previous lessons: 

- Missing data occur when no data value is stored for the variable in an observation.{{1}}



- Missing data commonly occur in real world data set.{{2}}



- Missing data can have a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data. {{3}}


`@script`
In the previous lessons, you have learnt about missing data which occur when no data value is stored for the variable in an observation.

You knew that Missing data commonly occur in real world data set which we can not avoid.

You also learnt that Missing data can have a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.

## Why missing data occur ?


```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "069bd0d21a"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
In surveys:{{0}}

- People may refuse to answer a question because of privacy issues.{{1}}

- People would have answered, but the answer was not one of the options provided.{{2}}
                       
- People may have lost interest while answering the questions and stopped. {{3}}
                    
- Perhaps, there wasn't enough time to complete the questionnaire. {{4}}


Every survey question without an answer is a missing data point. {{5}}


`@script`
Let's consider some examples to understand why missing data occur.

People may refuse to answer a question because of privacy issues. It could be age or income. Females do not want to share their age. People with low salary do not want to reveal their income.

## Different types of Missing Data

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "cbb56a97f3"
```

`@part1`
- MCAR  (Missing completely at random) {{0}}

- MAR   (Missing at random) {{1}}

- MNAR  (Missing not at random) {{2}}


`@script`
There are different types of missing data. The missing data can be MCAR (Missing completely at random), MAR (Missing at random) or MNAR (Missing not at random).


---
## What is MCAR ?

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "af3245f719"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
Missingness on a variable has no relationship with:
- the variable containing missing values
- any other observed variable


`@part2`

                    Complete data


`@part4`



`@script`
Missing data are MCAR when missingness on a variable has no relationship with the variable containing missing values and has also not related to any other observed variable.

## What is MCAR ?

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "39299cf4d7"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
Missingness on a variable has no relationship with:
- the variable containing missing values
- any other observed variable

## MCAR

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "259d78f57d"
```

`@part1`
- Impute {{0}}

- Delete observations containing missing data which will not bias.{{1}}


![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4411/datasets/2d4b381fa7d7d70f167d4f413eaafa74e1322721/MCAR1.jpg) {{2}}


`@part2`
- Loss of data {{3}}


`@script`
How to deal with the missing data if MCAR ? 
One approach is to impute them.

You can delete observations containing missing data which will not bias your results since it is MCAR.

There will be loss of data if you delete observations. If there is more that 5% data loss, imputation is advisable.

## What is MAR ?


```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "27199fa90f"
```

`@part1`
Missingness on a variable is:
- not related to the variable containing missing values 
- is related to some other observed variable  


**How to deal ?** {{1}}
1. Impute {{2}}
1. Deleting observations may lead to bias. {{3}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4411/datasets/366de251cf9dc8c0349b4a63f69d64bcfd93cf21/MAR.png) {{0}}


`@script`
What is MAR ?

Missingness on a variable is:
- not related to the variable containing missing values 
- is related to some other observed variable  

The values in Income variables are missing for people of age 30 or younger. So, missingness depends on the values of age variable but not on the values of Income variable since both low and high income values are missing.


---
## What is MNAR ?

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "67bf629fae"
```

`@part1`
Missingness on a variable is related to the values of that variable itself. 

**How to deal ?** {{1}}

- Nonignorable {{2}}

- Deleting observations will definitely lead to bias. {{3}}

- Imputation does not neccessarily provide better outcome. {{4}}

- Sensitive analysis {{5}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4411/datasets/73bce43860bda6b2226225d80dc9c3e92d756530/MNAR.png)  {{0}}


`@script`
What is MNAR ? 
Missingness on a variable is related to the values of that variable itself. 
In this case, only low income values are missing. So, the missingness depends on the values of the income variable itself.
